In-Raid DOTD Tier Display Tool v2
=================================

Purpose
-------
This is a test repository for my multitool script designed to allow database
self-updating and merge. Included is the in-raid tier script component, which
will eventually be stripped down and merged with the original DotD in-raid
tier script.

Controls
--------

* F12: Quit app
* Pause: Restart app
* F10: Start/stop raid monitoring/display
* Ctrl+F10: Open the script editor
